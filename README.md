- [x] implemented emailed, shared and viewed tabs, as proposed in test.

## Building and runnning

In order to execute the app you need to do the following steps:

- open new-york-times-ios.xcworkspace,
- execute scheme App.

## Introduction

![Image](resources/diagram.png)

The diagram shows how the app was built, the architecture focused on modularity, was decided to separate in five projects, feature, utilities, network layer, appearence and app. 
The decision was for to maximize the hability to reuse code, and make fast choices, by doing it you can build entire app with some features plugged, also inside each project there are modules. 
The project has a name that associate with a responsability and the module has a implementation, for example, Feature has this name because each module is a specific feature, there's NewsListKit, it's a module that has the list of news, and if you want to plug in another context, you can do it really quick without been tied to some other implementations, that's the power of SOLID.

## Main concepts

- The app used SOLID concepts, which means the decision to prefer modularity, is also some concepts that requires isolation and single responsability.
- Also the achitecture used Design Pattern for standard implementations, that for eg are factories and adapters.

## Modules

Here will be explained each project and how they work.
